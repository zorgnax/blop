markup: end of line whitespace to <br/> -- on second thought no, better
something like <pre markup="1">text text text</pre> because poems may
have start of line whitespace and **bold** formatting too. markup="1"
will be recursively set down so you can set it on <table> tag and have
it affect all the td's.

what about??:

<table markup="1"><tr><td>
one paragraph

two paragraph
</td></tr></table>

and

<table markup="1"><tr><td>
one thing
</td></tr></table>

I guess paragraph it then remove the paragraphing if just one.

or markup="1" is paragraphs, markup="2" is no paragraphs. (YES!)
