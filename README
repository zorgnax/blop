Blop
====

A Blog site written in Perl. Uses MySQL. Similar to WordPress.

Installation
============

Copy blop folder to your website's document root. It can also be placed
into a subfolder. Go to the website, and fill out the installation form
with a blog title, login info, and database details. Manage posts and
pages in the admin interface at /admin.

Features
========

- Complete top level URL control. example.com/about or
  example.com/mycategory or example.com/mycategory/subcategory. Posts,
  categories, and pages can all have whatever URL they want as long as
  they don't conflict with each other or an existing file.

    - A page can be the home page, the special "all" category can be somewhere
      else. /blog for example. Just edit the URL in /admin/pages and
      /admin/categories.

- Themes

- Plugins

- Only intended for one user to administrate/add posts.

- Files are organized by post, not date uploaded.

- html / markdown / bbcode hybrid input.

- Rich text editing is more trouble than it's worth.


Seven Unforgivable Sins of WordPress
====================================

- All the links to media, posts, categories, etc are absolute
  (http://example.com/category/foo)

- Tags automatically are converted to slugs of just the alphanumerics
  making it impossible to have tags like ":)" and ":(".

- Posting format is html, which makes it hard to write by hand. Plugins
  which add features to the editing format have no standard way of extending
  so they use search and replaces and that can cause conflicts.

- Written in PHP

- Doesn't let you edit your own comments.
