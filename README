=======

Installation
============

Copy the contents from the blop distribution into your website's document
root. It can also be placed into a subfolder. Go to the website, and fill
out the installation form with a blog title, login info, and database
details. Manage posts and pages in the admin interface at /admin.

    $ cd webroot
    $ wget blopblog.com/blop.tar.gz

Features / Ideas
================

*   Complete top level URL control. example.com/about or
example.com/mycategory or example.com/mycategory/subcategory. Posts,
categories, and pages can all have whatever URL they want as long as
they don't conflict with each other or an existing file.

*   A page can be the home page, the special "all" category can be
somewhere else. /blog for example. Just edit the URL in /admin/pages
and /admin/categories.

*   Tags can be anything, even ":)" and ":(". However, you should keep
in mind that whatever you choose will need to be uri-encoded, so your
urls may end up looking like /tag/%3A%29 and /tag/%3A%28.

*   Markdown/BBcode/HTML hybrid input. AKA Easy to write/Powerful/Flexible.

*   Themes

*   Only intended for one user to administrate/add posts.

*   Files are organized by post, not date uploaded.

*   Rich text editing is more trouble than it's worth.

*   Unlike Wordpress, all links are based at /, not http://.

*   Lets you edit your own comments.

*   If top to bottom is newest to oldest, left to right is newest to
oldest (prev and next links on posts).

*   Fully configurable sidebar and footer widgets.

*   Integrated analytics.

*   A simple and clean database schema.


Backups
=======

To download a backup of your site you could go to /admin/backup to
download an archive of all your files which includes dumps of all the
database tables. But a better way to do this is to use rsync which only
transfers changes:

    $ ssh -t mysite.com 'cd webroot; ./bin/dumpdb'
    $ rsync -hav mysite.com:webroot/ ~/backup/webroot
